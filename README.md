### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I would say it was more of learning and understanding more on the parent and child aspect of React

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have implemented a sidebar for my favourite, all and my watched 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I really like learning about react, learning more about props and state and creating components and also very interesting fetching from api. Next time, I would have a clear dropdown of what i want to achieve
